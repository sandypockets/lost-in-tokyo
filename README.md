# Lost in Tokyo

A single page website built with React. The project's purpose was to become more familiar with React, and styling components.

# Getting Started

The project does not have any dependencies that require installing. React, and React-DOM are both included in the `js/` directory. 

You can use the preinstalled Python on your local machine to run the server. 

1. Run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 5000` from the project directory. 
2. Navigate to [`http://localhost:5000/`](http://localhost:5000/) to view the page.

**Note**: If you're not seeing the changes reflected in the browser, then the browser might require a hard reset. If you're using Chrome on a Mac, press `cmd` + `shift` + `r`

**Note**: This server is _not_ hot-reload, and will require a manual page refresh to display any changes you introduce in the code.
