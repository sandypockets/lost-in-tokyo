# Lost in Tokyo

# Getting Started

1. Run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 5000` from the project directory. 
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/` to view the page.

**Note**: If you're not seeing the changes refelcted in the browesr, then the browser might require a hard reset. If you're using Chrome on a Mac, press `cmd` + `shift` + `r`

**Note**: This server is _not_ hot-reload, and will require a manual page refresh to display any changes you introduce in the code.
